            <h1>Lucky's Journey</h1>
            <p>I (Jaeda) adopted Lucky in 2022, and she is my soul cat. She loves cuddles and treats more than anything, and during our time together, she has transformed from a shy, anxiety-ridden cat into a playful, curious cuddlebug. She was only 4 when I adopted her and otherwise healthy, so I assumed that we would have plenty of time together.</p>
            
            <h2>Diagnosis & Treatment Costs</h2>
            <p>On March 4, 2025, Lucky was diagnosed with a ceruminous gland adenocarcinoma in her left ear. It’s a very uncommon form of cancer in cats and typical veterinary offices don’t have the resources to treat it. This means that we have to travel to the Hixson-Lied Small Animal Hospital in Ames for each of Lucky’s appointments – 4-5 hours round-trip.
            Treatment options depend on how deep her tumor is, but we have already spent thousands of dollars on diagnostic measures. She has had a laser removal surgery and biopsy (~$1600), an ECG and an x-ray (~$1500), and a CT scan (~$2000).</p>
            <p>Adenocarcinomas can metastasize (spread), so we are trying to move quickly. The deeper the tumor spreads, the worse Lucky’s prognosis becomes. For removal of the adenocarcinoma, we know the following:
            Total ear canal ablation and bulla osteotomy (TECA-BO) is the best treatment. This would remove the tumor and part of her ear canal, but she would essentially be cancer-free. The prognosis after this surgery is extremely good – often 5+ years. The estimated cost is ~$4000-$6000.
            CO2 laser ablation is a cheaper option if the tumor is limited to her external ear. The recurrence rate is higher than TECA-BO, but the prognosis is good. The estimated cost is ~$1400-$2500.
            Radiation therapy is an option if the tumor has spread to nearby tissues like bones or the lymph nodes. This is not ideal for us or for her. It would require weekly appointments and extra medication for side effects. The estimated cost is ~$7000+.
            Oral chemotherapy is our last option. If we cannot proceed with operative measures or with radiation therapy, Lucky will receive a chemotherapy pill 3x/week to slow the tumor’s growth/metastasis. The estimated cost is ~$300/month.</p>
            <p>We have also incurred hundreds of dollars in extra costs related to her treatment. Supplemental pain medications, antibiotics, and gas have added up quickly and will continue to accrue throughout the course of Lucky’s treatment.</p>
            <p>We will always put her and her quality of life first, but she is only 7 and we feel that it is not her time to go yet. If you are able to donate any amount toward Lucky’s vet bills, it is sincerely appreciated. If you are not able to donate, then please share! Word-of-mouth can go a long way, and anything helps.</p>
            <p>This page will be updated with current financial information at each step in the process. We will not be collecting more money than we need to pay for vet bills and gas.</p>   
            <p>Thank you very much for your support and time. Please share wherever possible and know that we are grateful for your generosity.</p>

            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <h2>Jaeda</h2>
            <p>My name is Jaeda. I recently graduated from the University of Iowa and I’m currently working as a paralegal and studying for the LSAT. I’m hoping to go somewhere top-tier (UVA, Stanford, Duke, etc.), but I’ll go wherever the money is!</p>
            <p>I adopted Lucky in 2022 from a tiny animal shelter in Monticello, IA. She had been declawed by a previous owner and was terrified of the other cats, so she would hide for hours under a little shelf in the corner of the room. When I visited the animals in the shelter that day, Lucky immediately crawled out from her hiding spot and started rubbing her head on me and licking my hand. Some people say that certain cats will choose you and that’s what Lucky did. I didn’t go looking for her that day, but she was definitely looking for me.</p>
            <p>She’s truly my emotional support animal and has been with me through some really grueling life experiences. I tried to get her pet insurance last year, but her seasonal allergies prevented me from getting coverage – she’d already had ear infections since her time at the shelter, so ear issues are now considered pre-existing conditions. Whatever happens with Lucky’s health, I’m forever grateful for my time with her and I am immensely lucky to have found her (pun not intended). </p>

            <h2>Jack</h2>
            <p>My name is Jack. I live with Jaeda and Lucky and am working towards a degree in my lifelong passion of computer science. I've never had a cat before and wouldn't have considered myself a cat person until I met Lucky. She really is the sweetest cat in the world and you can find proof of her ultra-cuddly nature on her TikTok page linked above. I made this website from scratch pretty hastily and apologize if it isn't the prettiest. I'm working on my fundraising skills, which is something that I find myself enjoying and will look for more opportunities to raise money for other people's animals in the future.</p>
